### 1. "Obeying the Messenger means following Hadith"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Verses command obedience to the Messenger (e.g., 4:59), implying we must follow his reported sayings and actions in Hadith.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“Obey God and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then upon him is only the responsibility for what he was charged with, and upon you is what you were charged with.” (Qur’an 24:54)
“Say: I only follow what is revealed to me.” (Qur’an 6:50)

**Refutation:**
Obedience to the Messenger means obeying the revelation he delivered. The Messenger is commanded to follow revelation alone (6:50), and his duty is to convey (balāgh, 5:99), not innovate or create external sources. Nowhere does the Qur’an equate “obeying the Messenger” with obeying books compiled two centuries later.

### 2. "The Prophet explains the Qur’an via Hadith"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The Prophet’s sayings (Hadith) provide explanation and context for the Qur’an’s meanings.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“We send down the Qur’an in stages, and We send down the Qur’an in stages, so that you may recite it to the people at intervals.” (Qur’an 17:106)
“We have sent down to you the Book to explain all things.” (Qur’an 16:89)

**Refutation:**
The Qur’an is self-explanatory and complete, revealed in clear stages for direct recitation and understanding. The Prophet’s role is to deliver revelation, not to add supplementary explanations beyond the Book itself.

---

### 3. "Hadith gives ritual details missing from the Qur’an"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Ritual practices are vague in the Qur’an; Hadith completes their specifics.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“Indeed, the righteous (musalīn) will be in bliss.” (Qur’an 82:13)
“And they who carefully maintain their connection (salāh) and those in whose wealth there is a recognized right.” (Qur’an 70:22–24)

**Refutation:**
The Qur’an describes qualities (moral and spiritual traits) rather than mechanical rituals. It does not prescribe specifics beyond clear ethical guidelines; details added by hadith lack direct Qur’anic mandate.

---

### 4. "3:31 – Follow Prophet = Follow Hadith"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
“Follow me” commands following the Prophet’s entire Sunnah, including Hadith.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“Say: If you love God, follow me, so God will love you.” (Qur’an 3:31)
“I only follow what is revealed to me.” (Qur’an 6:50)
“Obey God and obey the Messenger.” (Qur’an 4:59)

**Refutation:**
“Following the Prophet” means following the revelation he was sent to deliver. The Messenger’s authority stems from God’s revelation alone, not additional traditions.

---

### 5. "Kitāb and Ḥikmah = Qur’an and Hadith"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The “Book” and “Wisdom” mentioned in Qur’an 3:3 refer respectively to the Qur’an and Hadith.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“He has taught him the Book and Wisdom.” (Qur’an 2:129)
“And indeed, the Qur’an is wisdom.” (Qur’an 12:2)
“The Qur’an is a wise Book.” (Qur’an 31:2)

**Refutation:**
Wisdom (ḥikmah) is intrinsic to the Qur’an, not a separate body of tradition. The text distinguishes revelation’s wisdom from extra texts.

---

### 6. "Hadith is Wahy (unrevealed divine message)"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Hadith are a form of secondary revelation (Wahy ghayr matluw).

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“He does not speak from his own desire. It is revealed.” (Qur’an 53:3–4)
“Say: I do not know the unseen...” (Qur’an 6:50)

**Refutation:**
Only the Qur’an is confirmed as divine revelation. The Prophet’s speech outside it is not declared wahy, and the Qur’an explicitly limits the scope of divine speech to itself.

---

### 7. "59:7 – Take what the Messenger gives (includes Hadith)"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The Messenger’s authority to distribute spoils (fai’) implies obedience to all his sayings.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and what he forbids you, abstain from it.” (Qur’an 59:7)
“But the Messenger’s responsibility is only to deliver the message.” (Qur’an 5:99)

**Refutation:**
Context is limited to distribution of spoils. The Messenger has no authority to forbid or command outside revelation.

---

### 8. "Rejecting Hadith replaces it with opinion"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Without Hadith, Muslims rely on subjective personal views.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge.” (Qur’an 17:36)
“Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful.” (Qur’an 2:111)

**Refutation:**
The Qur’an alone is the objective, preserved criterion. Subjective opinions are rejected; reliance is on the Book’s clarity and authority.

---

### 9. "Qur’an is too general; needs Hadith details"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The Qur’an is broad and requires supplementary Hadith for application.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.” (Qur’an 16:89)
“This Qur’an is clear and fully detailed.” (Qur’an 41:3)

**Refutation:**
The Qur’an asserts it is clear, detailed, and complete, sufficient for guidance without external supplements.

---

### 10. "Hadith is preserved like Qur’an"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Hadith is divinely protected similar to the Qur’an.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“Indeed, We have sent down the Reminder, and We will surely preserve it.” (Qur’an 15:9)

**Refutation:**
Divine preservation is promised only to the Qur’an, not Hadith literature.

---

### 11. "The Prophet had legal authority beyond the Qur’an"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The Prophet legislated laws not explicitly mentioned in the Qur’an.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“And judge, \[O Muhammad], between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations.” (Qur’an 5:49)
“We sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.” (Qur’an 16:89)

**Refutation:**
The Prophet’s authority to judge is strictly limited to what is revealed. There is no permission for independent lawmaking beyond the Qur’an.

---

### 12. "Early Muslims followed Hadith, validating its authenticity"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The early community’s practice validates the authenticity and necessity of Hadith.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“And when it is said to them, 'Follow what Allah has revealed,' they say, 'Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.'" (Qur’an 2:170)
“Do not follow blindly the desires of a people who were given no guidance.” (Qur’an 6:116)

**Refutation:**
Following ancestral practice is no proof of truth. Guidance is exclusively in the revealed Book.

---

### 13. "Rejecting Hadith equals rejecting the Prophet"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Refusing Hadith means rejecting the Messenger’s authority and legacy.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“The Messenger’s responsibility is only to deliver the message clearly.” (Qur’an 5:99)
“Say: I do not ask you for any reward except love for the near of kin.” (Qur’an 42:23)

**Refutation:**
Accepting the Messenger means accepting the revelation he brought. Hadith is not mandated as part of his message.

---

### 14. "Isnād (chains) prove Hadith authenticity"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The chain of narrators authenticates Hadith reliability.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“O you who believe, if a rebellious evil person comes to you with news, verify it, lest you harm people unknowingly.” (Qur’an 49:6)
“And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge.” (Qur’an 17:36)

**Refutation:**
Verifying human chains is fallible; only divine revelation carries guaranteed truth and protection.

---

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Hadith completes what is missing or vague in the Qur’an.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“There is not an atom’s weight in the heavens or the earth but is recorded in a clear Book.” (Qur’an 10:61)
“And nothing have We omitted from the Book.” (Qur’an 6:38)

**Refutation:**
The Qur’an claims completeness and that nothing essential is omitted; supplementation is not warranted.

---

### 16. "Sunnah is revelation too"

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
The Prophet’s words outside the Qur’an are also revealed.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“He does not speak from desire; it is nothing but a revelation revealed.” (Qur’an 53:3–4)
“Say: I do not know the unseen...” (Qur’an 6:50)

**Refutation:**
Only the Qur’an is declared revelation; the Prophet’s other sayings are not divinely mandated.

“The Messenger judges only by what is revealed.” (Qur’an 5:48)

**Refutation:**
All judgments are to be based on revelation alone; extra-Qur’anic rulings are unsupported.

---

Consensus among scholars confirms Hadith authenticity.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
“And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you from the way of God.” (Qur’an 6:116)
“Only a few are truly guided.” (Qur’an 7:3)

**Refutation:**
Divine preservation is direct and not reliant on human transmission chains.

---

📌 **Sunni Claim:**
Hadith is indispensable for comprehending the Qur’an correctly.

📖 **Qur’anic Rebuttal:**
